# Ubuntu_Configure_files
Configuration files collection

As I was a new-comer to ubuntu, bash is the default option.
bashrc, record the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.

As time passed by, I discover another option, zsh.
It's more slick to deal with some operation.

vim is my best mate for coding!! :)

tmux helps me a lot, when I need to work among many terminals,
like developing ROS project. :p
